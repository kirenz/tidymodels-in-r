# Note

Hi Peter & Daniel,

I took the liberty of drafting several figures for our paper- all of them *will* have complementary tables too that help us meet current reporting guidelines. Please let me know what you think, and feel free to edit away and fill in as you feel inspired!

Alison


```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(arsenal)
library(here)
library(scico)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal())
```

```{r load-data, include=FALSE}
mockdata_all <- read_csv(here::here("data/mockdata.csv")) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("ae_")), ~as.factor(.)) %>% 
  mutate(fu_fct = fct_recode(as.factor(fu_stat), 
                             "Lived" = "1", 
                             "Died" = "2"))  

# see my note below re: sites
mockdata <- mockdata_all %>% 
  filter(!site == "Nur-Sultan")
```

All the code for these figures can be found in the `R` folder.

```{r, include = FALSE}
source(here::here("R/figs.R"))
```

Here are all the figures to play with, by which section I think they could go in:

```{r}
# demographics------------------------------------------------------------------
age_histogram

# treatment response @ follow-up------------------------------------------------
surv_pct_plot
surv_days_plot

# adverse events----------------------------------------------------------------
ae_pct_plot
```

For the `ae_pct_plot`, I followed [these recommendations](https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5078).

```{r fig.cap="BMJ, 2016 paper", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/F3.large.jpg"))
```

Also, our statistician advised that we may want to exclude any sites with `n` < 25. I think we need to flag the Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan site. Let's talk about this when we meet.

```{r counts-by-site}
ggplot(mockdata_all, aes(x = fct_infreq(site))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 25, colour = "red")
```
